Continuous Data Stream Generator:
A small Python script that simulates a continuous flow of data, similar to what an AI model might receive in real-world applications.
It generates mock values (such as temperature readings or other sensor-like data) and logs them into a file at regular intervals.

What This Script Does?
Produces random data repeatedly
Writes each new data point into a `.log` file

The included `data.log` file is an example of the output created when the script is run locally.

How to Run?

Run this in terminal:
'python3 data_stream.py'
A new `data_stream.log` file will be generated in the same folder.
